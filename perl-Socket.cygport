CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl low-level networking support"
DESCRIPTION="This module provides a variety of constants, structure
manipulators and other functions related to socket-based networking. The
values and functions provided are useful when used in conjunction with Perl
core functions such as socket(), setsockopt() and bind(). It also provides
several other support functions, mostly for dealing with conversions of
network addresses between human-readable and native binary forms, and for
hostname resolver operations."
